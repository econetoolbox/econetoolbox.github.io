abstract = {Summary Stochastic block models (SBMs) have been extended for bipartite networks in the form of latent block models (LBM) or bipartite SBM, which is equivalent. This chapter presents SBMs for both unipartite and bipartite binary networks and illustrates their flexibility. It discusses the statistical inference of these models: in this way, starting with an observed network, a description of the relations between groups of nodes can be obtained along with the groups themselves. Ecological networks are made up of nodes, representing biological entities of interest and edges representing the interaction being studied. The chapter applies the SBM analytical method to two ecological networks: a food web and a plant–pollinator network. The SBM model offers a means of summarizing the complexity inherent in the observation of over a thousand interactions. Note that SBMs are a special case of probabilistic network models including latent variables.}

	abstract = {Trying to unravel Darwin{\textquoteright}s entangled bank further, we describe the architecture of a network involving multiple forms of mutualism (pollination by animals, seed dispersal by birds and plant protection by ants) and evaluate whether this multi-network shows evidence of a structure that promotes robustness. We found that species differed strongly in their contributions to the organization of the multi-interaction network, and that only a few species contributed to the structuring of these patterns. Moreover, we observed that the multi-interaction networks did not enhance community robustness compared with each of the three independent mutualistic networks when analysed across a range of simulated scenarios of species extinction. By simulating the removal of highly interacting species, we observed that, overall, these species enhance network nestedness and robustness, but decrease modularity. We discuss how the organization of interlinked mutualistic networks may be essential for the maintenance of ecological communities, and therefore the long-term ecological and evolutionary dynamics of interactive, species-rich communities. We suggest that conserving these keystone mutualists and their interactions is crucial to the persistence of species-rich mutualistic assemblages, mainly because they support other species and shape the network organization.},
