The objective of this five-day course, co-organized by the 
[FRB-CESAB](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/about-the-foundation/le-cesab/)
and the
[ANR ECONET](https://cmatias.perso.math.cnrs.fr/ANR_EcoNet.html), 
is to train young researchers in analyzing ecological network data. The course covers a general introduction to networks, classical metrics (including modularity, nesteness, clustering), null models, generative models (including SBM), multilayer networks, as well as an overview of newer techniques (such as embedding). Each topic is explored through lectures followed by practicals.


## Tentative program (dates/hours may yet change) {.unnumbered}
